# UrbanOS Helm Charts

Helm charts for the SmartCitiesData platform (SCDP).

## Usage

Use our charts in two steps:

1. Add our repository with `helm repo add scdp https://urbanos-public.github.io/charts/`.
2. Install a chart with `helm upgrade --install ${RELEASE_NAME} scdp/${CHART_NAME}`. See the [Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/#helm-upgrade) for more options.

## Contributing

### Updates

1. Make changes to the chart.
1. Bump the chart version as part of those changes.
1. Submit a pull request.
1. When merged, the remote charts repo will be updated to include the new versions
   of the updated charts.

`helm search repo scdp/{chart}` (ex: `helm search repo scdp/urban-os`) can be
used to confirm that chart versions have been released properly to the remote.

You'll need to run `helm repo update` prior to search commands, as helm
search commands reference a local cache of the remote chart.

### New charts

1. Run `helm create ${CHART_NAME}` to create a new chart subdirectory.
2. Add templates, helpers, values, dependencies, etc. to your chart.
3. Submit a pull request.

## Master Chart

### Running

- (set up a connection to a kubernetes cluster using a [kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) or similar)
- `helm repo add scdp https://urbanos-public.github.io/charts/`
- Create a values file for configuring the deployment (e.g. deployment_values.yaml)
  - This file will contain configuration overrides for the deployment
- `helm upgrade --install urban-os scdp/urban-os -f deployment_values.yaml`
- Validate with `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`

## Documentation

Documentation per chart is generated by the [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) utility. After any change to values files, rerun the helm-docs command.

```sh
brew install norwoodj/tap/helm-docs
helm-docs
```
